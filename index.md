### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1, was my favorite because it was an introduction to arguments. The sandwich example was used in a previous lab; however, it was with cin. Typing out all three ingredients and seeing how the arguments order them was cool to see it work all at once. I believe this lab gave me a solid, basic idea of how arguments work and it helped become the framework for future labs with arguments.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2, was my favorite because I could develop a game that could be seen in apps or video games. I found bool very useful in this lab and could fully understand how the coding process worked until the end. I enjoyed using if, while, and else statements and how they all work together to give a specific output.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2, was my favorite because I learned how to pull information out of another file and use it in the current code I am using. Not only that, I was able to create a function to check the spelling of the words in those files. Not just one file, but all files were being checked by my code and I found that quite convenient, efficient, and cool. The use of functions makes coding easier as we are able to write the code separately and use it in our main code just by calling the function.
